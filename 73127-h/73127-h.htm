</div>


<p>In this book I have sought to give a glimpse of the musical life
of Philadelphia during the 18th Century, laying especial stress on the
secular music, and considering principally the German music produced
and performed, and emphasizing the high standard of musical
taste at this time.</p>

<p>While confining myself to secular music, I thought it necessary
in the first period to treat somewhat in detail the religious music,
especially as the religious music was of more importance in the first
half century than the secular music. So, too, I have gone into
detail somewhat more in the first two periods than in the last, because
these periods have not been so thoroughly investigated as the
last period has. It may be objected by some, that I have not
adequately considered the concert life of the last period. To these
I would say that this period has been fully covered by O. G. Sonneck
in his “Early Concert Life” in such a manner that I, at least, could
not improve upon it.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this book may help to correct the false impression,
that musical taste in America in the 18th century was an
unknown quantity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This study was undertaken at the suggestion of Prof. Marion D.
Learned and to him I am especially grateful for aid and encouragement
in preparing the work. To O. G. Sonneck of the Library of
Congress I am greatly indebted not only for material found in his
books on early American music, but also for his extreme kindness
in placing at my disposal unpublished material. His suggestions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
and encouragement have been of great help to me. I wish to acknowledge
here the courtesy extended to me by the officers and attendants
of the Pennsylvania Historical Society and the Library of
University of Pennsylvania and also the aid given to me by various
friends.</p>

<p>This Study was submitted in partial Fulfillment of the Requirements
for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, at the University
of Pennsylvania, 1909.</p>

</div>


<p>The early immigration of Germans to Philadelphia increased
to such an extent, that before the middle of the eighteenth century
the English colonists became alarmed for fear that Pennsylvania
might be alienated from the English crown, and be dominated by
the German immigrants. Indeed, throughout the eighteenth century
the greater part of the German immigrants landed at Philadelphia,
and from there were distributed into other States. We
should naturally expect, with so great a population of Germans
in Philadelphia and the surrounding country, that these people
would continually extend their influence, and constantly spread
abroad their ideas of art, religion, music and literature.</p>

<p>Let us consider for a moment the condition of the Germans
who landed in this country. In 1683, moved by William Penn’s
alluring proclamations of the glorious new world, as well as by
the fact that freedom of conscience was granted in Pennsylvania
to all, a band of German immigrants arrived in Philadelphia
and founded Germantown. With the exception of the
scholar, Francis Daniel Pastorious, there were no highly cultured
men or women among them. These people were of the middle
class, and were more interested in weaving and agriculture and
religious salvation, than in the cultivation of the fine arts. The
conditions in Germany were not conducive to culture.</p>

<p>The country was just recovering from the Thirty Years’
War, and the strength of the people was being expended in
building up the homes, and improving the land made desolate
during that fierce struggle. At this time, too, the German people
had little liberty, but rather were under the thumb of absolutism,
which was at that time the great force in European countries. It
was not an epoch favorable to the cultivation of the fine arts.
There was no great literature, no great art, no great music. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
was, however, a strong religious spirit, which is often the result
of hardship and suffering. It is in the field of religion, too, that
we find the best music during the seventeenth century, although
it was not original in style, but simply a continuation of Luther’s
music.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The hymn-writers of that time, both Catholic and Protestant,
are not to be despised, and we need mention but a few,
whose songs have lived even to the present day: as Paul Fleming
(1609-1640) and Paul Gerhardt (1606-1676), Protestant; Friedrich
Spee (1591-1635) and Johann Scheffer (1624-1677), Catholics.
It can be said, then, with some degree of surety, that the
performance of music by the early German settlers in Philadelphia
was confined, in the province of music, to hymns.</p>

<p>In this department the Germans hold an important position;
not only was their church music an essential part of their services,
but the number of hymn-writers and the many editions of
German hymn-books published in Philadelphia testify to the love
which these new settlers had for church music.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to mention a few of these hymn-writers
to recall to mind the extreme productiveness of this style of literature
and music. Among the most important hymn-writers were
F. D. Pastorious, of Germantown; Johann Kelpius, of the Wissahickon;
Conrad Beissel, of Ephrata, and Count von Zinzendorf,
the Moravian.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To Francis Daniel Pastorious has been assigned the honor of
being the first German hymn writer on American soil. Pastorious<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
was born Sept. 26, 1651 at Sommerhausen, Germany, of cultured
parents of some means and position in society. His father Melchior
Pastorious had studied Catholic theology and also jurisprudence,
but had finally renounced his faith and had become a Protestant.
Needless to say Francis Daniel’s education was not neglected. He
was sent to school in various places: as Windsheim, Basel, Nuremberg,
Erfurt, Strassburg where he studied law and the French language,
Jena where besides law he studied Italian, and finally he took his
degree of Doctor of Laws at Altdorf, 1676.</p>

<p>He settled now at Frankfurt am-Main and practiced his profession.
He probably continued in this work until 1680, when, as
the companion of Johann Bonaventura von Rodeck, he made a
journey, extending over two years, through Holland, England,
France, Switzerland, and Germany. Upon his return to Frankfurt,
November, 1682, he became interested in the mysticism of Spener and
his companions, and the movement to America which they were
promoting—filled him with an ardent longing to share in it. So,
with the consent of his father who provided him with money, Francis
Daniel set sail for America and arrived in Philadelphia Aug. 20,
1683, six weeks before the other immigrants landed.</p>

<p>Pastorious was the only highly educated man in this colony. He
was looked up to by the other colonists for this reason, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
because he was the agent of a land company formed in Germany
for the purchase and sale of land in Pennsylvania. The new colonists
chose as the spot for their new homesteads a tract of land not far
from Philadelphia, where they founded Germanopolis or Germantown.</p>

<p>On Nov. 26, 1688, Pastorious married Ennecke Klostermanns
and had two sons, whose descendants live at the present day.
In 1691, Pastorious was elected to the newly-created office of
“Bürgermeister,” an office to which he was chosen three other times.
Besides this office, he was for many years elected to the position of
“Stadtschreiber,” and was also schoolmaster at different times.
He was known as a writer of some talent, and composed poems,
hymns, epigrams, etc., in Greek, Latin, German, French, Dutch,
English and Italian. I will close this bare outline with Pastorious’
account of himself as quoted by Seidensticker:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Der Verfasser dieses Manuscripts hat ein melancholis-chcholerisches
Temperament und ist daher, nach Culpepper,
sanftmüthig, zu einem nüchternen eingezogenen Leben disponirt,
wissbegierig, unentschlossen, bescheiden, schüchtern, bedächtig,
standhaft, und zuverlässig in seinen Handlungen, langsamen Witzes,
vergesslich. Geschieht ihm Unrecht, so trägt er es nicht nach.”</p>
</div>

<p>This remarkable man died Sept. 27, 1719.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Pastorious’ hymns are up to the standard of most hymns written
at that time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In point of time the next hymn-writers were the so-called
“Hermits of Wissahickon,” a band of men and women steeped in
German mysticism, and having a belief that the end of the world
was soon to come and that their one love should be the Lord Jesus
Christ; so on this account renouncing marriage as sinful. It was in
this wilderness, beside the Wissahickon Stream about eight miles
from Philadelphia, that this band of Pietists in the year 1694 took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
their abode, and from whence issued the strains of hymns, reminding
one, in some instances of love songs rather than praises to God.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
There were in this congregation a number of men of high culture
and lofty aims such as Johann Kelpius, Henry Bernhard Köster,
Johann Gottfried Seelig, etc.</p>

<p>The most important man was Johann Kelpius, their leader,
who composed the greater number of their hymns.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Kelpius was
the son of a pastor in Denndorf in the Siebenbürgian district of
Germany. He studied theology at Altorf, where he was a pupil and
favorite of the learned doctor, Johann Fabricius.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fabricius vertrat,” says Seidensticker, “die sogenannte
irensche oder friedliebende Schule der Theologie, die von der
bittern Fehde gegen andere Confessionen absah. Kelpius, anfangs
ein strenger Calvinist, griff den Gedanken an ein innerliches Christenthum
begierig auf und bildete ihn unter andern Einflüssen weiter.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1689, Kelpius obtained his master’s degree. In the years
following he composed an essay entitled: “Scylla Theologica,
aliquot exemplis Patrum et Doctorum, etc.” About this time he
must have obtained a knowledge of the religion of the mystics, and
must also have come under the influence of Jacob Böhme’s philosophy,
and Spener’s theosophy.</p>

<p>Such was the man who led the band of hermits, which arrived
in Philadelphia, June 23, 1694. His life on the Wissahickon was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
one of pious contemplation, and striving to follow out his idea of
Christianity. He died 1708.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Hon. S. W. Pennypacker has in his possession a hymn
book composed by these people, in which some of the hymns are
dated 1707. He reports that Kelpius wrote nineteen hymns; another
writer possibly Köster thirteen hymns; and Seelig four hymns.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Not only did these “Hermits” worship God with song, but
they undoubtedly accompanied their voices with musical instruments,
since we know that they brought the latter with them from London.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Also we find Kelpius in one of his letters desiring that two clavichords
with additional strings might be sent.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This simply goes to show
that this little band of religious fanatics was not deficient in musical
ability, and also that they carefully nurtured their love for music.
Gradually these Pietists died or renounced their faith and were
received into other religious societies,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and in the latter case one
may be sure that their musical instruments went with them and were
played and listened to with pleasure in a far wider circle than formerly.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to consider in detail the various German
hymn-writers in Pennsylvania, as the field is far too large, and besides
the composers for the most part, were not inhabitants of Philadelphia.
There are a few men, however, of sufficient importance to be considered,
even though they lie somewhat without our field of operation.
Perhaps the most picturesque figure in the history of American music
in this century is Conrad Beissel of Ephrata Cloister. He not only
evolved a <i>new</i> system of music, but was also the <i>first</i> composer of
music in America. He wrote hymns and chorals in four, five, six,
and seven parts, while usually in other congregations the hymns
were sung in unison.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The first edition of Ephrata hymns was published by Benjamin
Franklin, Philadelphia, 1730, while different editions of new hymns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
appeared in 1732, 1736, 1739, 1754, 1755, 1756 (2 eds.), 1762, and
1766.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Of these hymns, over 1,000 are attributed to Conrad
Beissel. Not only did he compose music, but he also wrote the first
treatise on harmony in America.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Concerning the quality of the
music Dr. J. H. Sachse says: “The peculiar sweetness and weird
beauty of the songs of the sisterhood, and the impressive cadence of
the chorals and hymns of the combined chorus”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is strikingly seen.</p>

<p>Before the end of the century nearly all the sects of the Pennsylvania
Germans had their editions of hymn-books, for the most part
abridgements of those in use in the mother country. A few sects,
however, had men versed in poetry as well as religion, and these
helped to swell the hymn-books, already in use, with new songs.
The Moravians were especially prolific, and under the direction of
Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf, who himself wrote over 130 hymns
in this country, produced a work of some importance. “No
authorized hymn-book for the Moravian church was issued in
America during the colonial period, but a small collection printed at
Germantown by [C.] Sauer [in] 1742, ‘Hirtenlieder von Bethlehem’”
was popular.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Zinzendorf was not the only hymn writer among
the Moravians, since there were also his two wives, his son, Bishop
Spangenberg and others, who had some ability in this line. In
speaking of the “German American Hymnology,” Hausmann
remarks that the hymns of all sects were subjective, excepting those
of the Moravians.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the 18th century, Philadelphia and Germantown were the
two—for a time the only two—important printing centres of Pennsylvania,
and here it was that the greater number of German hymn
books were printed. There can be no doubt, I think, that many of
these German hymns were known to most of the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Philadelphia, but as to whether or not these hymns had any influence
upon the people, we are as yet, not prepared to say. At this time, we
can do no more than enumerate the different editions of German
hymn-books printed in Philadelphia and vicinity during the 18th
century, although we hope that we may later investigate them
thoroughly. In 1744 the Brotherhood of the Inspired produced
an abridgement of a larger European collection. This became
a favorite with the different Separatist bodies. It was called
“Das Kleine Davidische Psalterspiel der Kinder Zions.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This
book contains 530 pages, and was printed by C. Sauer, Germantown.
In 1752 Sauer reprinted the “Marburg Reformed Hymn Book;”
1753<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “Die Kleine Harfe,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> 1762, Marburg edition of the Lutheran
hymn-book,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and also in this same year the first edition of Schwenkfelder
hymns,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> some of which were composed in this country, others
taken from the Lutheran and Reformed hymn-books, but based,
in great part upon the hymn-book of the Bohemian Brethren. It
contains 917 hymns.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In 1763 was printed the “Marburg Reformed
Hymn-Book;”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in 1786 the earliest original collection of Lutheran
hymns in this country, entitled “Erbauliche Liedersammlung;”
1788 “Liebliche und Erbauliche Lieder,” “Unparteiische Lieder
Sammlung,” and others published by the German Baptist Society;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
1797 “Neues und verbessertes Gesangbuch” printed by Steiner &amp;
Kammerer, Phila., 1799, a third edition of the “Marburg Lutheran
Hymn Book”.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The total number of editions of German hymn-books
during this century was twenty-two, but besides that there was
a German hymn-book translated into English in 1795.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Church Music and the Manner of its Performance.</span></p>


<p>It has already been mentioned that there were many
German hymn-writers in Philadelphia in the early eighteenth
century, and it is now in place to consider what was the quality of
the music in the German churches at that period, and whether
musical instruments of any kind were used in the Philadelphia
churches.</p>

<p>For the first record it is necessary to go a little beyond Philadelphia
to the Hermits of the Wissahickon. To this people undoubtedly
belongs the honor of first using instrumental music
in religious services. Of their voyage across the Atlantic, Kelpius
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had also prayer meetings and sang hymns of praise and
joy, several of us accompanying on instruments that we had brought
from London.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Evidently the instruments which they brought with them
were not satisfactory or were regarded as inadequate for the
worship of God, as Kelpius in a letter to friends in London asked
that two clavichords with additional strings might be sent.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Again the Hermits at the consecration of the new Swedish
church—Gloria Dei—July 2, 1700, act as choristers and furnish
instrumental music.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The first German minister ordained in this country was
Justus Falckner, who was consecrated by the Swedish Lutherans.
In a letter to Rev. Heinrich Muhlen, of Holstein (1701), Falckner
shows that, even at that early day, music was considered an important
adjunct of the church service. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In short there are Germans here, and perhaps the majority, who
despise God’s Word and all outward good order; who blaspheme the
sacraments and frightfully and publicly give scandal....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<p>“I will here take occasion to mention that many others besides
myself, who know the ways of the land, maintain that music would
contribute much towards a good Christian service. It would not
only attract and civilize the wild Indians, but it would do much good
in spreading the Gospel truths among the sects and others by attracting
them. Instrumental music is especially serviceable here. Thus
a well-sounding organ would perhaps prove of great profit, to say
nothing of the fact that the Indians would come running from far
and near to listen to such unknown melody, and upon that account
might become willing to accept our language and teaching, and remain
with people who had such agreeable things; for they are said
to come ever so far to listen to one who plays even a reed-pipe (rohr-pfeiffe):
such an extraordinary love have they for any melodious
and ringing sound. Now as the melancholy, saturnine stingy
Quaker spirit has abolished (relegiert) all such music, it would
indeed be a novelty here, and tend to attract many of the young
people away from the Quakers and sects to attend services where
such music was found, even against the wishes of their parents. This
would afford a good opportunity to show them the truth and their
error.</p>

<p>“If such an organ-instrument (Orgel-werck) were placed in the
Swedish church ... it would prove of great service to this
church.</p>

<p>“If there were music in the church, the young people would
consider church-going a recreation.</p>

<p>“The Lord of Hosts ... would be praised and honored
with cymbal and organ.</p>

<p>“And it may be assumed that even a small organ-instrument
and music in this place would be acceptable to God, and prove far
more useful than many hundreds in Europe, where there is already
a superfluity of such things.</p>

<p>“There are in Europe masters enough who would build such
instruments, and a fine one can be secured for 300 or 400 thalers.
Then if an experienced organist and musician could be found, and
a curious one, who would undertake so far a journey, he would be
very welcome here. In case this could not be, if we only had an
organ, some one or other might be found who had knowledge thereof.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>The writer of this missive was somewhat of a poet himself,
and composed several fine hymns, some of which are in use at
the present day.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Whether the appeal for musical instruments was of avail,
we know not, but in the <i>Journal of Rev. Andreas Sandel</i> for July 20,
1702, is mentioned one Jonas, organist of Gloria Dei church. Again,
on November 24, 1703, when Falckner was ordained in this church,
Sachse says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The service was opened with a voluntary on the little organ in
the gallery by Jonas the organist, supplemented with instrumental
music by the Mystics on the viol, hautboy, trumpets (<i>Posaunen</i>) and
kettle drums (<i>Pauken</i>).”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The first church organ in Philadelphia, then, was placed in
a Swedish Lutheran church largely by means of a German. Although
the merit for this achievement must be divided between
the Germans and Swedes, in one department of music—the singing
of hymns—the Swedes probably were pre-eminent. In 1696
Charles, King of Sweden, sent to the church at Wicacoa, one
hundred hymn-books,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> while in 1712 another lot, consisting of
“360 hymn books of three sorts” were shipped.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The Swedes
were strict, too, in the regulations of the church services, especially
of singing. In 1702, Rev. Andreas Sandel imposes a fine “for
untimely singing, six schillings.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Especially interesting is the
account concerning the attempt of Pastor Andreas Hesselius, of
Christiana, Delaware, to reform church singing in 1713. Acrelius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He had special regard to propriety in church-singing, in which
there was often such discord as though they intended to call their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
cows to the church. In opposition to which it was represented that
as all those who possessed the gift of praising God with a pleasing
voice in psalms and hymns should not stand mute, so, on the other
hand, those who were unfitted for this should not with their harsh
voices, hinder others and make confusion, but, by softly singing after
the others, train themselves to correct singing. During the singing,
he went around the church and aided where they failed.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is very probable that in Philadelphia, this same instruction
in church singing prevailed, since Hesselius was for some
time Provost, and had a right to command, and also, because
Samuel Hesselius, his brother, occupied the pulpit at Wicacoa
and could more easily be coerced—if necessary—to establish this
method of instruction.</p>

<p>In the other churches of Philadelphia, organs seem to have
been introduced at a relatively late date. On September 2, 1728,
a committee having been appointed at Christ Church “to treat
with Mr. Lod. C. Sproegel,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> about an organ lately arrived here,
report that they had done the same, and that he insisted on &#163;200
for said organ; and that they had procured men of the best skill
this place could afford to erect the said organ in a convenient
house in town, to make trial thereof; which, being done, it is said
the organ proves good in its kind, and large enough for our
church.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Upon this recommendation the organ was purchased.
In the Moravian church, corner of Race and Broad streets, there
were two organs in 1743<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> one of which was sold in 1796, and
a new one built by David Tannenberger.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In this same year
(1743) the Moravians in Germantown had an organ costing &#163;60,
but in 1744 both church and organ reverted to the German Reformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Church.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The Catholic church had an organ in 1750.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
These are the earliest known organs in use in Philadelphia churches.
From this time on, the other churches in the city gradually established
them as an aid to their services.</p>

<p>One writer, who came to this country from Germany, evidently
had no knowledge of these organs when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I came to this country with the first organ [1750] which now
stands in a High German Lutheran church in the city of Philadelphia,
and which was built in Heilbronn.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the face of the evidence already produced, it is needless
to say that this statement is a little off color, to say the least.</p>

<p>There were then in Philadelphia several organs before 1755,
and it is reasonable to assume that in the Moravian church, that
“wind” and “string” instruments were used, since we find this
true at the colony in Bethlehem.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The testimony of travellers
of that time or of members of other churches is of some interest
and importance. The first witness is William Black, secretary
of the commission appointed by the Governor of Virginia to
unite with commissions from Maryland and Pennsylvania for
the purpose of treating with the Indians. In the year 1744, he
resided in Philadelphia, during which time he kept a journal
of interest and importance. June 8 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We went to the Moravian Meeting, where I had the pleasure
to hear an Excellent Comment on that Passage in Scripture Relating
to the Prodigal Son, and after <i>some very agreeable Church Music</i>,
half an hour after 9 they broke up.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>This testimony is not without its value, as this gentleman
was evidently somewhat of a musician himself, since under the
same date in his diary we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I Rose from my Bed and pass’d two hours in writing, the
rest of the time till Breakfast, I spent with my Fiddle and Flute.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Concerning the music in the Moravian church we have other
evidence, at a later date. John Adams remarks in his diary for
October 23, 1774:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The singing here [Methodist meeting] is very sweet and soft
indeed; the first <i>music</i> I have heard in any society <i>except</i> the
Moravians, and once at church with the organ.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He also remarks September 4, 1774, upon “the organ and
a new choir of singers at Christ Church, which were very musical.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Franklin, in 1755, speaks of hearing Moravian music at
Bethlehem, and praises it generously.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> A year earlier Acrelius,
who visited the same place, gives a more detailed account in the
following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was finally agreed that we should sit below [in the auditorium
of the church], as the music sounded better there. The
organ had the accompaniment of violins and flutes. The musicians
were back in the gallery, so that none of them were seen.” One of
the ministers “read some verses of a German hymn book, after which
they were sung with excellent music.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Their style of music and manner of performing it must
have been exceptionally good, as compared with the music of
other churches, to have impressed so favorably such men, who,
we may be sure, were quite different. There is the sturdy pastor
Acrelius, understanding church music and the manner of its
performance; the cordial, genial Ben Franklin, who knew something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
about music from living in London; the somewhat cold
but highly cultured, John Adams, with his Puritan traditions;
then the gentleman from Virginia, William Black, who most
probably partook of the nature of the warm, sunny-tempered
Southerners, himself somewhat of a musician. Could we ask for
witnesses more unlike?</p>

<p>To the Moravian church undoubtedly belongs the palm for
music during the eighteenth century; but there was music, and
good music, in some other churches as well. We have already
mentioned the music in Christ Church and the Methodist
Church. Concerning the music in the German Lutheran Church,
we have the testimony of Daniel Fisher, who writes in his <i>Diary</i>
for May 25, 1755:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Went to the Lutheran Church, a neat Brick Building where
there is a good organ<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to which I heard them sing Psalms, agreeably
enough.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Lutheran Church has an organ, and a good one.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There were organs then in the churches, to a great extent,
before 1750. The question now arises: Were there men who
could repair these instruments if they got out of order? By the
end of the fifth decade, there were several men who could
not only repair an organ, but also build one. Of these men Gustavus
Hesselius is the most important, as he was the first spinet
builder in America, having produced specimens as early as 1743,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and probably the first organ builder in Pennsylvania. It is claimed
that he was the first organ builder in America, and in support of
that claim an organ is mentioned as built by him for the Moravian
Church at Bethlehem, Pa., in 1746.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The fact is lost sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
that a Boston man, Edward Bromfield, generally regarded as
the first organ builder, constructed an instrument in 1745.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
However Hesselius was undoubtedly the first man who built many
church organs.</p>

<p>Still another claimant appears for this title—no less a man
than the Englishman, Doctor Christopher Witt (1675-1765),
another hermit of the Wissahickon. Doctor Witt possessed a
large pipe-organ presumably made by him alone, but possibly
aided by other Hermits. It was built at least while he was living
with the settlement on the Wissahickon, and as he left that society
shortly after the death of Kelpius,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which took place about
1708,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the evidence is in his favor. This organ at his death was
valued at &#163;40.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Hesselius was not only a musician, but a painter as well. He
died in 1755.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Connected with Hesselius in 1746 was John G.
Klemm, a native of Dresden, Germany. Three years later David
Tannenberger arrived in Philadelphia, a man whom many of his
contemporaries conceded to be the greatest organ builder in
America, but, as is usually the case, there is another claimant for
this high honor, as will be seen later.</p>

<p>David Tannenberger<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was born March 21, 1728, in Berthelsdorf,
Saxony. He was evidently an all-round musician, and could
play, sing—he possessed a good voice—build, or repair an organ
as occasion presented itself. It is known that he built at least
fourteen organs during his stay in Pennsylvania, while no record
of the number of spinets, which he made and sold for &#163;22.10<i>s</i>,
has been discovered.</p>

<p>As to Tannenberger’s reputation as an organ builder, we
have the testimony of a man who probably knew Tannenberger:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tannenberg belongs to history as <i>the</i> organ builder of his day
and one of renown. He too, was of the German school. Fancy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
stops were not generally in vogue, except the trumpet in the great
organ, and the vox humana in the swell, of which latter there was
but one in the city, and that was in Christ Church, and to my young
ear, a good imitation of the human voice.</p>

<p>“There are several of Tannenberg’s organs yet in breathing
existence [1857]. Lancaster, Litiz, and Nazareth still hold his
memory in audible and respectful tones; and much of his work is
worthy of imitation. His diapasons were particularly dignified,
whilst his upper work, 12th, 15th, and sesquialtera, gave brilliancy to
the whole.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This testimony of Abraham Ritter, an organist of good
standing in the Moravian Church, gives some idea of the excellence
of the work and of the reputation which Tannenberger still
had in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In a letter written from Lancaster, Dec. 24, 1770, the following
testimony is added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yesterday we had the pleasure of hearing, for the first Time,
the new Organ, in the High Dutch Reformed church of this Place,
accompanied with a variety of vocal Music, composed on the Occasion
which I may venture to say, not only from my own Experience, but
the Approbation of all present, was never equalled in any Place of
Worship in this Province, or perhaps upon this Continent. The
Organ was made by Mr. David Tannenberg, of Litiz, a Moravian
Town not far from this Place; and I dare venture to assert, is much
superior in Workmanship and Sweetness of Sound, to any made by
the late celebrated Mr. Feyring, who was so justly taken notice of
for his Ingenuity; does great Honour to the Maker; is worth the
Attention and Notice of the Curious, who may happen to pass this
way; and will undoubtedly recommend him to all who are desirious
of having Works of that Nature.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In spite of his reputation as an organ builder, we learn that in
1790 he was a bankrupt.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He died May 19, 1804, stricken by
paralysis while tuning an organ at York, Pa.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>We have already spoken of Gottlieb Mittelberger and his
organ, and, although we cannot depend upon his statements, there
may be some truth in his somewhat exaggerated account of the
dedication of his organ. It is at least interesting, and shows that
the people as a whole were certainly not prejudiced against music.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After this work had been set up and tuned it was consecrated
with great rejoicing and delivered to the Christian St.
Michael’s Church for the praise and service of God.</p>

<p>“The crowd of hearers was indescribably large; many people
came from a great distance, 10, 20, 30, 40 and even 50 hours’ journey,
to see and hear this organ. The number of hearers, who stood
inside and outside the church, both German and English, were
estimated at several thousands. I was appointed school-master and
organist. As I became more and more known in Pennsylvania, and
the people learned that I had brought fine and good instruments
with me, many English and German families came 10, 20 and 30
hours’ journey to hear them and the organ, and they were greatly
surprised because they had never in all their lives seen or heard an
organ or any of those instruments.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“At the present time [1754] there are 6 organs in Pennsylvania—the
first is in Philadelphia, the 2nd in Germantown, the 3rd in
Providence, the 4th in New Hanover, the 5th in Dulpehocken, all
of them came to this country during the four years of my sojourn
there.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This statement concerning the number of organs in Philadelphia
cannot be true, as we have shown above that there were
several. In his list of the organs in Pennsylvania, he neglects
to mention the one made for the Moravian Church at Bethlehem
in 1746.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The number of people which he claims was present
at the dedication is probably exaggerated, and, as Mittelberger
was the chief performer, we can pardon him this slip of the pen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
It is probable, however, that there was a large number of people
present, as there would be at any new event entering into their
narrow lives—especially as there was no charge for admission.</p>

<p>In 1762 a new organ was built in Philadelphia by Philip
Feyring for St. Paul’s Church. He is the other claimant to the
honor of being the greatest organ builder of his day.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> One of
the newspapers was evidently partial to him, since it gives this
notice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The New Organ, which is putting up in St. Paul’s Church in
this City, will be in such Forwardness as to be used in Divine Service
on Christmas Day. It is of a new Construction, and made by Mr.
Philip Feyring,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Musical Instrument-Maker, in this City, who may,
with Justice, be said to be the best Hand at that ingenious Business
on the Continent.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The organ was evidently in use on Christmas day and must have
proven satisfactory to call forth the following poem lauding both
Feyring and his organ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Fyring is a German by Birth, but has for some years past,
practic’d the making of Musical Instruments (particularly Spinets
and Harpsichords) in this City, with great Repute.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This effusion explains itself. His workmanship must have
been of superior quality, as it was seldom that a musician at that
time—or even at the present day was much noticed, let alone
publishing a poem about him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>How many instruments were sold by these organmakers it
would be difficult to say, although undoubtedly parlor organs were
found in many houses. There are advertisements of two organs
for sale among a list of household goods before the end of 1750:
A “small” organ belonging to Benj. Morgan, 1748,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and a “large”
one, the property of the late Peter Kook, in 1750.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Religious music in this half century was flourishing, and
was considered a valuable adjunct of the church service, not only
in German churches, but also in the Swedish and English
churches. The composition of hymns up to this time seems to
have been confined to the Germans.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Secular Music.</span></p>


<p>From the preceding chapter it has been clearly seen, that the
Germans in Philadelphia, and indeed in the whole State, were
strongly religious, and were celebrated for their church music
and instrument makers, especially for their organ builders.</p>

<p>Were all the people in Philadelphia as religious as the Germans
and Quakers seem to have been, and were there no public
amusements? This is an important question, and one not easily
answered, especially during the first half of the eighteenth century.
It may be thought that this question is not related to German
music, but indirectly it is, so that it may be shown whether
or not the people of Philadelphia were ready to welcome music,
whether they were in a state of mind favorable to the introduction
of any amusements. It is necessary to establish these facts
before we can clearly understand the reasons and cause for the
introduction of German concert music into America.</p>

<p>We know, that in Philadelphia during the eighteenth century,
there were men of every creed and religion, of every walk
of life, of many different nationalities, and we may be sure that
in such a conglomeration of men and ideas there would be some
to whom amusements would be necessary—even amusements
which strait-laced people would condemn. The information there
is upon this subject supports the opinion, that there were amusements
even in the early part of the eighteenth century. Foremost
among the pleasures in which the inhabitants of Philadelphia
indulged, was dancing, and we have reference to this art at an
early period. In a book written in 1710 is the following statement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the rest of my Friends, I must not forget the facetious
Mr. Staples, Dancing-Master, who was the first Stranger of Philadelphia
that did me the Honour of a Visit.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
</div>

<p>As early as 1716 we find this record:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the Yearly Meeting of the Friends, members were advised
against ‘going to or being in any way concerned in plays,
games, lotteries, music and dancing.’”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Throughout the first half of the eighteenth century dancing
was evidently held in due respect by a certain element of the population.
In 1728 it forms a part of the curriculum of a boarding
school.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In 1730 dancing is taught by Thomas Ball’s sister.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
The first really fashionable ball was probably that given by Governor
Gordon, in 1726, in honor of the Prince of Wales’ birthday.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
To some extent, too, music and dancing were surely a
part of the marriage festivities, as the following item shows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We hear that Tuesday night last, a young Dutchman was
married to an old Dutchwoman, who was known to have money.
They had a fiddle at the Wedding.... She danc’d till it
was late.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We find ministers of different denominations complaining of
the irreligion of some of the inhabitants. As one writer remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We live in an age, when ’tis counted almost a scandal to be
a Christian. Religion is stil’d Preciseness and Hypocrisy, and a
strict Conformity to Truth and Virtue is imputed to be the Effect
of Melancholy, a Distemper’d Imagination. We daily hear the
greatest Mysteries of our Faith Ridicul’d and Banter’d, the Clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Despis’d, Expos’d and Degraded; and that even by Men, who have
not yet Publickly Renounc’d Christianity; but such as would be
thought to have clearer Heads, and more refin’d Conceptions of
Things than their Brethren, those Men to their Shame stand Pelting
Religion at a distance, with little Scoffs and Jests, when there is
a more Fair and Honourable way of deciding the Matter, by rational
and undeniable Arguments.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In opposition to this we have the testimony of Benjamin
Franklin, who writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our people, having no publick amusements to divert their
attention from study, became better acquainted with books.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
</div>

<p>So, too, a correspondent in the <i>Weekly Mercury</i> writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Here are no Masquerades, Plays, Balls, Midnight Revellings,
or Assemblies to Debauch the Mind or promote Intrigue.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When, however, we read an advertisement in the same paper
about a month later like the following, we may be permitted to
doubt somewhat the statements of the last two men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Art of Dancing Carefully Taught (as it is now Practic’d
at Court) by Samuel Perpoint, at his <i>School</i> ... where for
the Recreation of all Gentlemen and Ladies: There will be <i>Country
Dances every Thursday Evening</i>; likewise he teaches small Sword.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From this time on, we notice the advertisements of various
dancing masters, who, often were school masters at the same time.
Not only did these Philadelphians enjoy dancing, but they were
partial to late suppers and card playing as well,—playing cards
was a staple article of importation after 1736.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Another favorite
amusement, we may be sure, was playing on the Jew’s harp,
for after 1733, this instrument frequently is advertised.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Jew’s harp must have been considered a harmless instrument by
all sects, for as early as 1675 in one State of Puritan New England
it is stated that a law was enacted, “that no one should play
on any kind of music except the drum, the trumpet and the jewsharp.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Besides the amusements already mentioned, the Philadelphians
had an opportunity to see a rope-dancer in 1724,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> “Punch
and Joan his Wife,”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> “Magick Lanthorn” exhibition,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> “Camera
Obscura and Microscope,”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> a musical clock with a man and woman
appearing as mountebanks.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Music was evidently popular at society meetings, banquets,
etc. Perhaps there was nothing more than singing, but possibly
a violin and spinet helped to while away the time. For instance,
in 1731 at the celebration of “St. David’s Day,” by the “Society
of Ancient Britons,” the evening ended with “Musick, Mirth and
Friendship.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In the two items which will be given now, may be detected,
perhaps, the incipient germs of musical criticism, or at least the
idea, which most people probably had of what a professor of music
should know and be able to do:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Elocution is not unlike Musick; there is scarce a Soul so rustick
as not to admire both in their Excellency, altho’ the Masters of
those Sciences may lose their proper Share of the Praise. He that
having laid before him the several Parts of a Musical Instrument,
can Unite them in their Places, and tune them to Harmony, merits
the appelation of a Master in Musick and should be distinguished as
such, as he that disposes Words into grammatical sentences, and
eloquent Periods, is a Master of Language.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>This quotation may argue for the popularity and respect in
which music was held at that time by at least some of the people.
We find in this crude statement, that music was thought worthy
of a position by the side of elocution, which has always held a high
place in the minds of every people, and so we may be safe in believing
that music had a place, and an important place, in Philadelphia,
in the early history of that city.</p>

<p>Another correspondent states that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Women, like Instruments of Musick, require to be long used
before their Sweetness or Discord are certainly discovered.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Unless the writer of the above knew something about music,
and unless music was an object of interest or pleasure, so that
this comparison would be appreciated, he would not likely have
ventured to use such a simile.</p>

<p>In 1733 there is a record of a “ball”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> while, in the next year
under the heading “London news,” there is a notice concerning
the marriage of the Princess Royal to the Prince of Orange, which
gives the following information:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A fine anthem compos’d by Mr. Handell was perform’d by a
great Number of Voices and Instruments.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This latter item proves nothing except that the name of Händel
was introduced into the colonies at an early date, and may have
remained in the memories of some of the people, since he was connected
with such an important event. This may possibly have
helped to increase the popularity which his works, later in the
century, attained in America.</p>

<p>It has been seen that there was music and dancing at this
time, and it is now interesting to learn what kind of musical
instruments were used. It has been shown already, that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
were Jew’s harps,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that Kelpius had clavichords,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and assuredly
there were some virginals, although probably few. In the fifth
decade the various instrument makers mentioned above,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> probably
had quite a number of customers.</p>

<p>In 1729 Andrew Bradford, proprietor of the <i>American Weekly
Mercury</i>, advertises:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A well-strung Virginal to be sold; being in good Order. Enquire
of Printer hereof.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Christopher Witt, referred to before,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> was a capable
player on the virginal,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> which at his death was appraised at &#163;1,
15<i>s.</i>;<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> while a virginal belonging to the “Hermits” reverted to the
widow of Magister Zimmerman.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The people who owned instruments of this kind had an
opportunity to learn to play, since in 1730 a woman—the first
music teacher in Philadelphia—makes an announcement in the
newspaper as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Thomas Ball’s] “Wife teaches Writing and French. Likewise
Singing, Playing on the Spinet, Dancing and all sorts of
Needle-Work are taught by his Sister lately arrived from London.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>
</div>

<p>What class of music she and her pupils played, it would be
hard to say, but it did not cause anyone to start a music store,
and it is not until 1739 that any great musical works are advertised
at the office of the man of many parts, Benjamin Franklin.
The following pieces were to be obtained there: “Corelli’s Sonatas,
Geminiani’s Concertos, Ditto’s Solos.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Besides spinets and virginals there were probably violins,
German flutes, trumpets, drums, a few viols, etc. For instance,
in 1749 Anthony Lamb, of New York, advertises among other
things: “German Flutes,”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> while other men advertise, in 1750,
“Hunting Pipes,”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and “fiddle strings.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> From 1744 on numerous
advertisements of drums appear.</p>

<p>Before 1740 there is no record of any kind of musical organization,
but in this year there was such a society. During this
year the evangelist, Whitefield, visited Philadelphia and made
a strong impression upon people of all beliefs. One of his
disciples caused this to be printed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since Mr. Whitefield’s Preaching here, the Dancing school,
Assembly, and Concert Room have been shut up, as inconsistent
with the Doctrine of the Gospel: and though the Gentlemen concern’d
caus’d the Door to be broke open again, we are inform’d that
no Company came to the last Assembly night.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
</div>

<p>One of the members, however, denied the charge that dances
were inconsistent with the doctrine of the gospel, and affirmed
that the hall was closed up by William Seward, an “Attendant
and intimate Companion” of Whitefield. This same writer speaks
of “Members of the Concert” and the rooms belonging to them.
He also says that the members “met the Night after according to
Custom; and the Thursday following the Company met to Dance
as they used to do; but the Assembly being only for the Winter
Season is now discontinued of Course and the Concert being for the
whole Year still goes on as usual.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>This is interesting, as it is the first record of concerts, and
also, because these <i>concerts</i>, continued the <i>whole</i> year, not merely
during the winter months as nowadays. There were “Members
of the Concert,” too, who rented or owned rooms. There must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
then have been some kind of a club or society, which gave these
performances.</p>

<p>These concerts must either have been kept up for years, or
new series instituted year by year, since our friend William Black
(already quoted) says in his diary of 1744, June 5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At 8 O’Clock went to hear a Concert of Musick; the Performers
was some Town’s Gentlemen, and did Us the Honour of an
Invitation, we staid till past 11, and I left the Company to go home
to my lodgings.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is important to observe, that William Black says he had
the “Honour” to be invited to a concert. One might say that this
word was simply a common expression. It probably was, and still
is; but we believe a man would hardly write such an expression
in his diary, unless he really thought he was honored. It seems
probable that this concert and those of 1740 must have been very
exclusive and were not public entertainments, which anyone might
attend.</p>

<p>There was exhibited this same year (1744) a curiosity,
which would attract a large crowd of people. This was no less
than:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Unparallelled Musical Clock, made by that great Master
of Machinery, David Lockwood. It excels all others in the Beauty
of its Structure and plays the choicest Airs from the most celebrated
Operas with the greatest Nicety and Exactness. It performs
with beautiful graces, ingeniously and variously intermixed,
the French Horn, Pieces, perform’d upon the Organ, German and
Common Flute, Flageolet, etc., Sonata’s, Concerto’s, Marches, Minuetts,
Jiggs and Scots Airs, composed by Corelli, Alberoni, Mr. Handel
and other great and eminent Masters of Musick.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is the first public record we have, that works of such
famous composers were played, and they must have become
familiar, in a short time to a great number of inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Miss Ball’s capabilities in the
province of music were confined to but two branches, voice and
spinet. In 1749, however, appears a truly musical genius, if we
may judge by the number of instruments which he played. This
man was, as we learn from the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Beals, Musick Master from London [who] at his House
in Fourth Street, near Chestnut Street, joining to Mr. Linton’s, collar
maker, teaches the Violin, Hautboy, German Flute, Common Flute
and Dulcimer by Note.</p>

<p>“Said Beals will likewise attend young ladies, or others, that
may desire it, at their houses. He likewise provides musick for balls
or other entertainments.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here was an opportunity for the inhabitants of the Quaker
City to improve their time by learning music, and as the variety
of instruments from which they might choose, was large, no doubt
some of them became proficient musicians.</p>

<p>This same year saw the beginnings of drama and opera in
Philadelphia, given by the English actors, Murray and Kean.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
These dramatic performances were soon discontinued on account
of the opposition of the public. From now until the latter part
of the sixth decade of the eighteenth century there were desultory
attempts to give dramas, but not until 1759 did the theatre prove
successful and become permanent.</p>

<p>There was then in this decade an incipient appreciation of
drama to which some music was oftentimes joined. What other
music was there at this time? In 1750-4 Mittelberger says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cultivation of music is rather rare as yet.... Some
Englishmen give occasional concerts in private houses with a spinet
or harpsichord.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mittelberger’s statement concerning the cultivation of
music is not quite true. Music undoubtedly was studied a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
deal more than Mittelberger seems to think. If his statement that
occasional private concerts were given by Englishmen is true, this
was probably the kind of concert William Black attended in
1749,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and may have been similar to the concerts of 1740.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century Philadelphia
was not so utterly devoid of musical culture as some of our historians
of music would have us believe. The music was not entirely church
music, and although musical culture was not so important a factor
in the life of the people as at the present day, still music was beginning
to make itself felt among intelligent people, and interest in it and
appreciation of it were gradually growing.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Music Teachers.</span></p>


<p>From the preceding chapters it will be evident that secular
music was beginning to be a force in the life of the people although
the religious music certainly in the first half of the 18th century was
more prominent. From 1750 on, however, secular music gradually
but surely replaces religious music to a great extent, and becomes to
all intents and purposes the noticeable feature of the musical life of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The introduction of German concert music strange to say,
evidently was not due to Germans, although the various German
teachers of music may later have aided in popularizing the music
of their native land. Too much credit cannot be given to the
different music teachers from England, who inaugurated public
concerts in Philadelphia, where the works of the greatest artists
of Germany, England, and Italy were produced.</p>

<p>As early as 1729<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> a music teacher appeared in Philadelphia,
while in 1749<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> another member of the profession advertises for
pupils. From now on this class of men increases, but there is noticeable
lack of teachers with German names. The greater part of these
men were English; a few French, Italians, and Germans being present
also.</p>

<p>In 1755 appears an unique advertisement showing that some of
the German music teachers were not dependent upon music alone
for a livelihood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The subscriber proposes to open a school on Monday next, in
the house where the late Mr. Quin<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> formerly dwelt, for the instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of Gentlemen and Ladies, in the following accomplishments:</p>

<p>“First, The French, Italian and German languages, in a method
concise and easy.</p>

<p>“Secondly, To play on the violin after the Italian manner, with a
peculiar method of bowing and shifting in solo’s or concerto’s.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, Drawing and miniature painting with colours, flowers,

<p>“He has a variety of music, composed by the most eminent

</div>

<p>Five years later another accomplished German music teacher
appeared upon the scene, whose modest advertisement is a relief
after reading the previous effusion. This man confines himself to
the German flute, which seems to have been an instrument of some
importance at that period. This notice runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is to inform the Public,</p>

<p>“That an Evening School for teaching young Gentlemen to play
upon the German Flute will be opened by the Subscriber ...
where young Gentlemen may be taught, by an easy and regular
Method, to play with Judgement and Taste, for the moderate Price
of Six Shillings per Week, and Thirty Shillings Entrance Money,
provided the Subscriber can procure six Scholars. The Hours of
Attendance will be every Evening (Sundays excepted.) from 6 to
8 o’clock. Said Subscriber will also attend Gentlemen at their
Houses, one Hour every other Day, for one Guinea per Month and
Thirty Shillings Entrance.</p>

<p>
John Stadler.<br>
</p>

<p>N. B. If any Gentleman is desirious to know the character
and abilities of said Subscriber as a Teacher of Music, they may be
satisfied by enquiring of any Gentleman in this City, who is a Judge
of these Matters.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is to be noted that Stadler opened a <i>school</i> for his instrument,
which emphasizes the popularity which this instrument must have
enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Two years later another German flutist, George Isenberg or
D’E’issenburg<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> increased the force of teachers in Philadelphia.
Again we find in 1774 Peter Kalckoffer advertising to teach the beloved
German flute as well as the Latin tongue.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Probably the most important of these German musicians was
H. B. Victor, who went from Germany to London, in 1759,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
whose advertisement appears in 1774—an advertisement worthy to
be placed alongside of some of those of the present day. He seems
to have been an inventor of musical instruments as well. The number
of instruments he plays at once, remind us of some of the street
musicians of the present day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Victor, Musician to her late Royal Highness the Princess
of Wales, and Organist at St. Georges in London, lately arrived here,
takes this method of acquainting the Musical Gentry in general,
that he gives instructions on the Harpsichord, or Forte Piano,
Violin, German Flute, etc., especially in the thorough Bass both in
theory and practice, for that his pupils may soon come to a fundamental
knowledge of that fine science.</p>

<p>“N. B. Mr. Victor intended to give a concert, and to perform on
his new musical instruments, but is obliged to postpone it for want
of able hands; the one he calls Tromba doppia con Tympana, on
which he plays the first and second trumpet and a pair of annexed
kettle-drums with the feet all at once; the other is called cymbaline
de amour, which resembles the musical glasses played by harpischord
keys, never subject to come out of tune, both of his own invention.
He is to be met with at his house in Callow Hill street near Water
street.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to this advertisement, Victor must have been a
whole conservatory of music in himself. However he was a musician
of some note in our early history, and as such is worthy a place here.</p>

<p>As would be expected the remainder of this period brings no new
teachers to notice as the colonies were busied with far more important
matters.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Music Dealers, Etc.</span></p>


<p>To supply the needs of his pupils it is necessary for a music
teacher either to carry a line of musical wares himself or to satisfy
his wants from a merchant dealing in such things. For some time
it is quite likely that each teacher imported his own musical merchandise,
although it has already been noted that, at an early date,
Benj. Franklin had some music on sale.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> As in every business
there is some one ready to grasp an opportunity, so in the music
business a man stepped forward to relieve the teachers of buying and
selling. This man was Michael Hillegas, who in 1759 opened, what
may be called, the first real music store in Philadelphia. A glance at
the following advertisement will not belie this claim.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To be sold by Michall Hillegas, at his House in Second street,
opposite Samuel Morris, Esq., an extraordinary good and neat
Harpsichord with four stops; a good Violin-cello, an Assortment
of English and Italian Violins, as well common ones, as double lined,
of which some extraordinary; a parcel of good German Flutes, imported
here from Italy. Also imported in the last ships from London,
a large Assortment of Musick, of the best Masters, viz.: Solo’s,
Overtures, Concerto’s, Sonata’s, and Duets, for Violins, German
Flutes, Hautboys, French Horns, Violoncello’s, and Guitars, Voluntaries,
Lessons for Organs and Harpischords, ruled paper of various
Sorts for Musick, and Musick Books, Tutors or Books of Instructions
to learn to play on the Violin, German Flute, Hautboy, or Common
Flute, without a Master, Song Books, Cantatas, Songs on Sheets, and
a Choice Parcel of Violin Strings, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>From this advertisement may be deduced many things. In the
first place, such an inventory of stock would not be sneered at by a
music dealer of the present day; we may be sure then that the
people were musical and that there was a demand for the things
advertised. We should suppose that violins and German flutes were
the most popular instruments and were in great demand; while
there was certainly more than one player—perhaps many—of the
above, common flute, French horn, ’cello, and guitar; and of course
there were organists and harpsichord players.</p>

<p>Thus we are certain, that, in a few years that the people must
have progressed rapidly in music, and probably now it was considered
a necessary part of every young lady’s and young gentleman’s
education. Music paper, too, is advertised by Hillegas. This may
have been used in copying compositions of other writers as we
know Hopkinson did,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> or, perhaps, there were composers at that
time of whom there is no record. The song-books, cantatas, and
songs imported would be those in favor in London, as musical taste
at this period in Philadelphia was a reflection of English taste.</p>

<p>The name of Michael Hillegas will live as long as the United
States hold together, as he was an important figure in the early
history of our country.</p>

<p>Michael Hillegas<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> was born April 22, [O. S.]——in Philadelphia
of German parents. The tradition runs in the Hillegas
family that their ancestors were French. They had a coat of arms
containing three musical staves. However that may be Michael’s
parents came from Baden and settled in Philadelphia, where Michael
Sr. was naturalized April 11, 1749. He was a merchant, and was
interested in real estate and prospered exceedingly. At his death
Oct. 11, 1749, his property was valued at &#163;40,000 of which his son
Michael had two shares.</p>

<p>Michael Jr. now carried on the business of his father. He was
popular, devoted to music and a skilful player on the flute and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
violin, and a composer of “An Easy Method for the Flute.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> As
early as 1753, he advertises a church or house organ.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Politically he was important, held various offices in Philadelphia,
and upon the adoption of the constitution became treasurer—the
first treasurer of the United States—an office which he held
throughout the war.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Such in brief was the man who kept the first store of musical
merchandize. His influence in musical matters must have been
felt, although it cannot be proven. That he had good musical taste
or that the public did is seen from the list of standard works which
he advertised in 1764<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> including those of Tartini, Hass, Noseri,
Alberti, Vincent, Carter, Miller, Balicourt, Tessorini, Reed, Stanley,
Viaci, Cervetto, Davis, Quants, Martini, Weideman, Hellendaal,
Pepush, Triemer, Wodizka, Corelli, Depuis, Avison, Humphreys,
Alcock, Festnig, Händel, Vivaldi, Boyce, Ruge, Price, Burney,
Fisher, Ferigo, Flackston, Bates, Retzel, Benegger, Bezozsi, Albinoni,
Graun, Stamitz, Fritz, Barbella, Richter, Kleinecht, Lampugnini,
Pasquali, M’Gibbon, Dottel, Gerard, Stechwey, Battino, Campioni,
Claget, Agzell, Figlio, Diragini, Lanzetti, Kunzen, Scarlatti, Smith
[Schmidt?], Barbandt, Berg. This is a list of names of composers
which, at that time were popular and some of which hold an important
place in the musical world of to-day.</p>

<p>Although Michael Hillegas, probably for some time, had almost
a monopoly of the selling of musical merchandize, it was not long
before another firm usurped the position which Hillegas had held in
the musical world, and apparently crowded him out of business, as
his advertisements, after a short time, are few and gradually cease
altogether. The music-house par excellence which now came to
the front was that of the English book-sellers, Rivington &amp; Brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
who carried a remarkably large stock of musical merchandize.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
However we are only concerned with those storekeepers of German
descent so we will have to pass by this large and prosperous establishment.</p>

<p>Soon after this Theodore Memminger, a liquor dealer, advertises:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Fine Parcel of Violins, at a very low Price. They are all
made by the best Masters in High Germany. He has likewise the
best Sort of Fiddle Strings.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1768 he seems to have increased his music business, as the
following notice shows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Variety of violins at different prices; the best kind of fresh
fiddle strings: guitar and spinnett brass and steel wire: a fine pair
of very good ivory German flutes. He spins all sorts of bass strings
with silver wire.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Most of this business seems to have been in the hands of the
English for with the exception of one more German Conrad Batis,
who advertises among other things “a quantity of violins and violin
strings,”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> no other German music dealer has been discovered.</p>

<p>There is, however, one more event of importance to chronicle,
before leaving the music dealers. It has been already stated that
harpsichords and spinets were made in Philadelphia at an early period.
It remained for John Behrent, a German, to add to the renown of
Philadelphia in the realm of music. In 1775 he advertised:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Behrent, Joiner and Instrument Maker living in Third
street continued in Campington, directly opposite Coate’s Burying-ground,
Has just finished for sale, an extraordinary fine instrument,
by the name of Piano Forte, of Mahogany, in the manner of an harpischord,
with hammers, and several changes: He intends to dispose
of it on very reasonable terms: and being a master of such sort of
work, and a new beginner in this country he requests all lovers of
music to favour him with their custom, and they shall not only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
honestly served, but their favours gratefully acknowledged, by their
humble servant, John Behrent.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Evidently the War of the Revolution interrupted any further
progress in musical development, as nothing more of importance
is found during this period.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Concert Music.</span></p>


<p>In a previous chapter it was shown that a kind of subscription
concert was given as early as 1744, and although there is no record
of public or private concerts being given for sometime after that, it
is only natural to suppose that at least private chamber concerts
were given.</p>

<p>We may be sure that bands were a feature at an early date, and
no doubt added somewhat to the musical life of Philadelphia. It is
not until 1755, however, that there is any mention of such an organization.
However in that year we learn that a “Band of Musick”
headed a procession of Masons on St. John’s Day.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> How important
this procession was considered by the onlookers is seen from
the testimony of Daniel Fisher who writes in his diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should observe that on St. John the Baptist Day (June 24)
there was the Greatest Procession of Free Masons to the Church and
their Lodge, in Second Street that was ever seen in America. No less
than 160 being in the Procession in Gloves, Aprons, etc., attended
by a band of Music.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This band probably was not like those of the present time, but
may have been satisfactory to the inhabitants of old Philadelphia.
We may assume it was similar to a drum and fife corps, although this
assumption may do injustice to the musical taste of that time.
Anyway we have the year following a more detailed description of a
procession including music.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Philadelphia Regiment consisting of upwards of 1,000
able-bodied men after being reviewed and performing the Manual
Exercises [went] thro’ the Town in Three Grand Divisions ...
with Hautboys and Fifes in Ranks ... [and] Drums between
the third and fourth Ranks.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is certainly a small beginning but the band had come to
stay and apparently was popular, and probably was used in most
processions and public celebrations. After the victory at Louisburg
fireworks were displayed in Philadelphia and a performance of a
“Band of Music playing Britons strike home.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>At a later date bands of the British regiments stationed in
Philadelphia, aided at the public commencements of the “College
and Charity School”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> now the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The year 1757 is very important in the history of music in
Philadelphia. We have now the “first <i>public</i> concerts on record,”
says O. G. Sonneck.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The advertisement runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By particular Desire. On Tuesday next, the 25th instant, at
the Assembly Room, in Lodge Alley will be performed a Concert of
Music, under the direction of Mr. John Palma,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> to begin exactly at
Six o’clock. Tickets to be had at the London Coffee House, at one
Dollar each, and no Person to be admitted without a ticket.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another concert was given March 25th, of this same year.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
This year, too, a man appears in musical circles, who undoubtedly
exercised more influence upon musical affairs in Philadelphia than
any one man before or since. This is no other than Frances Hopkinson,
statesman, signer of the Declaration of Independence, Lawyer,
Writer, Inventor, Composer of Music, etc., etc. His contributions
to the music and musical taste of this country is little known, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
when we say that the evidence points to him as the first native composer
in America, although Jas. Lyon of this city may have been—they
both wrote music as early as 1759<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>—this fact makes him a
man of the greatest importance in musical circles. We wish to
correct here a statement made by various writers on American music,
that William Billings was the first American composer. This is
absolutely false, since Hopkinson and Lyon composed music at least
ten years before Billings did, while the latter was yet a child.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to give a short account of Frances
Hopkinson, laying particular stress upon his musical labors, especially
as regards German music.</p>

<p>Frances Hopkinson was born in Philadelphia, Sept. 21, 1737,
the son of Thomas and Mary Hopkinson. He must have been keen,
active, and studious, since, while yet a boy of twenty, he received
his degree with the first class ever graduated from the College of
Philadelphia. From now on he advanced in knowledge and in
favor with the world. In 1760 he received the degree of Master of
Arts from his Alma Mater, and in 1763 received the same degree
from the College of New Jersey. In 1790 his own college conferred
upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws.</p>

<p>His public life was too active to give more than the briefest
sketch. His first public office was that of secretary to the governor
in a conference between the latter and the Lehigh Indians. From
now on, he held many offices, as secretary of the Library Company
in 1759; 1772 Collector of the Port of New Castle; 1774 held a seat
in Provincial Council of New Jersey; 1776 delegate to the Continental
Congress; signer of the Declaration of Independence; 1779 Judge
of the Admiralty from Pennsylvania; 1778 Trustee of the College
of Philadelphia. Besides this, he wrote many political pieces of
which “The Battle of the Kegs,” 1778, was the most popular. He
was also for a time organist in Christ Church, instructor in psalmody,
a pillar of the church, and an inventor of improvements for the
harpsichord.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Our first knowledge that Hopkinson studied music is a notice
in the magazine containing his “Ode on Music,” which remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Written at Philadelphia by a young Gentleman of 17, on his
beginning to learn the Harpsichord.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The only professional music master at that time was John
Beals,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> but, later, 1757, came John Palma<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and in 1763 James
Bremner.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Hopkinson may have taken lessons from any or all
of these men for all we know to the contrary; but it is certain that
he was a pupil of Jas. Bremner, a Scotch musician of some note.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Hopkinson made his first public appearance as a musician
probably in 1757 when the “Masque of Alfred”—words by Thompson-Mallett;
music by Dr. Arne—was given at the College of Philadelphia
as an exercise in oratory.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He may have been accompanist
for this performance.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note with what music Hopkinson was
acquainted at this time and for this purpose I shall quote from
Sonneck’s exhaustive work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The torso of a book with the memorandum ‘Frances Hopkinson,
1755,’ attracts our attention. It is in manuscript, possibly of the
owner. Most pieces have a figured base, and are Italian, French,
English trios, songs, and duets, arranged for the harpsichord, amongst
them for instance ‘A Song in the Triumph of Hibernia,’ an ‘Air in
Atalanta’ by Händel, and a famous ‘Water Piece’ by the same
author.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another book of manuscript bearing the date, 1759, contains
pieces by “Händel with <i>ten</i> pieces (Samson, evidently being Hopkinson’s
favorite oratorio by the master), ‘Signor Palma,’ and ‘Signor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Vinci’ both with four: Arne with two; Pepush (Alexis a Cantata!)
Dr. Boyce, Pergolesi, and Purcell with one piece.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>A third volume called “Lessons”, date not given, contains,
among others, compositions by: “Händel ‘who (<i>predominates</i>,)
Scarlatti, Abel, Stamitz, Vivaldi, Galuppi, Pugnani, Stanley, Smith,
[Schmidt], Pasquali, Giardini, Corelli, Geminiani, Lord Kelly.’”[162]</p>

<p>From these manuscripts it will be seen that Hopkinson was
familiar with many of the best composers of the world. He was
evidently especially fond of Italian and English composers, but we
may judge that he liked Händel’s music best of all. In the list
directly above there are mentioned the following Germans: Händel,
Abel, Stamitz, Schmidt; also the Englishman, Stanley, was a
particular friend of Händel, and his music, as was all music of
England at that time, must have been modeled after Händel’s;
then there is Lord Kelley who studied music in Germany. We
believe that the greater part of this music was brought to Hopkinson’s
attention by the music-masters from London, and if that is so, it
naturally follows that others of their pupils became acquainted with
standard composers. We may be sure, too, that Händel, who was
almost idolized in England during this century, had impressed these
English American music-masters with his importance, and they
would not keep to themselves their knowledge of him and his works.
Händel, says one writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For nearly a century ... stood to the English school as a
model of everything that was good and great, to such an extent that
very little of original value was accomplished in that country, and
when, by lapse of time and a deeper self-consciousness on the part of
English musicians, this influence had begun to wane, a new German
composer came in the person of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who,
in turn, became a popular idol, and for many years a barrier to
original effort.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To turn again to Hopkinson we find that he not only had
manuscript books of music, but also printed works such as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Six Sonatas for the Piano Forte or Harpsichord, Composed by
Frederick Theodor Schumann, Opera 5th <i>London</i>.[162]</p>

<p>“Händel’s Songs selected from the Oratorios.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then there were books by Italian composers, with which we
are not concerned.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>From the evidence already presented, it will probably be granted
that, the German concert music which was found in Philadelphia
in the early 18th century, was brought in rather by the English
musicians than by the Germans. We find the taste for music in
London reflected by the various music teachers, and by the actors
who came to Philadelphia from London during the sixth and seventh
decades. This English influence lasted until the War of the Revolution
during which there was a period of quiescence. After peace
was restored, the English, Germans, and French—the latter exiles
and victims of the French Revolution—all aided in the continuance
of high class music.</p>

<p>Subscription concerts or in fact concerts of any kind seem to
have gone out of fashion in Philadelphia, but in 1764 there was an
awakening and a series of concerts was instituted, beginning January
the nineteenth; “to be continued every other Thursday, till the 24th
of May following. No more than 70 Subscribers will be admitted,
and each, on paying Three Pounds for the Season, to have one
Lady’s Ticket to be disposed of every Concert Night, as he thinks
proper.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>This then was a series of subscription concerts and must have
been confined to the aristocracy of the town. The next year another
series of such concerts was given,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> so they were evidently quite
successful. Of these concerts there has been no program discovered,
but in the spring of 1765 there is a program of a concert, which is
probably representative of the programs given at that time. The
advertisement for this concert is of interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Wednesday evening the 10th Instant at the College Hall in
this City was performed a solemn Entertainment of Music under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Direction of Mr. Bremner;<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> interspersed with Oratorios, by some of
the young Students.... Nearly One Hundred and Thirty
Pounds was raised for the Benefit of the Charity Schools belonging
to the said College.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The program included overtures of Stamitz, Kelly, and Arne,
and Martini, and a concerto of Geminiani; also, sacred songs, orations,
and a violin solo.</p>

<p>Besides these exhibitions there were probably concerts of
chamber music, as witness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Even in the last century [18th] it was usual for families to have
meetings at their houses for their improvement in music. Governor
Penn, who played the violin, had musical soirees every Sunday
evening at his house in South Third Street, during a portion of the
year. Dr. Adam Kuhn, himself an amateur, attended them.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The first definite mention of an orchestra was in 1767 when it
was announced that the singing in the Southwark Theatre was
“accompanied by a Band of Music.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> An estimate as to this
orchestra is herewith given: violins, flute, harpischord, oboe, ’cello,
trumpet, and, perhaps, French horn and drum.</p>

<p>There were sparks in the town, who also, indulged in serenading
their lady loves, an account of which is given by <i>an Englishman</i> in
a letter to his sister:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Sister, ... Pray (as old Polonious says) when you
‘was young and in love,’ did you approve of serenading? It is
extremely in vogue here now. The manner is as follows: We, with
four or five young officers of the regiment in barracks, drink as hard
as we can, to keep out the cold, and about midnight sally forth,
attended by the <i>band</i>, which consists of ten musicians, horns, clarinets,
hautboys, and bassoons, march through the streets, and play under
the window of any lady you choose to distinguish; which they
esteem a high compliment. In about an hour all the blackguards
who sleep upon the bulks, with gentlemen of a certain profession
who sweeten the streets at night, are collected round, drawn by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
charm which soothes a savage breast, and altogether make it extremely
agreeable in a fine frosty morning.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In this letter are mentioned clarinets and bassoons, instruments
possibly not common in Philadelphia. The band probably belonged
to the regiment of which the writer was a member, and was very
small compared to the regimental bands of to-day.</p>

<p>That there could not have been many professional musicians
in Philadelphia is shown by a notice concerning the Southwark
Theatre in 1769:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Orchestra on Opera Nights, will be assisted by some musical
Persons, who as they have no View, but to contribute to the Entertainment
of the Public, certainly claim a Protection from any Manner
of Insult.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Evidently at this early period people were beginning to be
critical, and, as the orchestra did not come up to their expectations,
they did not hesitate to show their resentment.</p>

<p>It has been said that no concerts are to be traced in Philadelphia
in 1766 and 1767.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In 1767 however, Mr. Garner, a teacher of
psalmody advertises four charity concerts,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> upon which a little
light is thrown by the following notices given by Mr. Garner concerning
one of these concerts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The vocal parts by Mr. Wools, Miss Wainwright, and Miss
Hallam. The greatest care shall be taken to render the entertainment
pleasing and satisfactory.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The program not being in existence, we cannot say with a surety
what character it assumed. It may have been partly of a sacred
character, but it is also likely, since the three singers mentioned
belonged to the theatre, that the program had at least a semi-worldly
tinge.</p>

<p>In 1767 arrived in Philadelphia an Italian, John Gualdo, who
exercised, for a few years, a great influence upon the musical taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of the people. His choice of music was not limited to compositions
of Italian masters, nor to his own compositions, since one of his
advertisements states, that the instrumental music is “by Messieurs
Geminiani, Barbella, Campioni, Zanetti, Pellegrino, Abel, Bach,
Gualdo, the Earl of Kelley, and others.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Sonneck dates Gualdo’s first concert Nov. 16, 1769,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> but
according to the following advertisement it would seem to have
taken place a month earlier:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To The Public</span>:</p>

<p>“At the Assembly Room, on next Wednesday (being the 18th
of October) will be performed a concert of vocal and instrumental
music, for the Benefit of a little Master, not seven years old, who will
give a specimen of his early abilities.—The concert to be directed by
Mr. Gualdo, after the Italian Method. Tickets at a Dollar a piece....
After the Concert, the company (if agreeable) shall be
furnished with a set of players, without any expences, in order to
end the evening with a ball.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Handbills were distributed giving
the program.</p>
</div>

<p>In his next concert, Nov. 16, two of his performers were Germans,
if we may judge from the names. Mr. Curtz played the harpsichord,
while Mr. Hoffman Jr., was a clarinet soloist.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Another concert
not noted by Sonneck was to be given after the races on Sept. 27,
1770.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In his next advertisement Gualdo gives a list of the
instruments to be used in his next concert, as follows: violins, German
flutes, French horns, clarinet, harpischord, and mandolin.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In
1771 Gualdo gave his last concert. This same year is important as
it brings to our notice a German, Philip Roth, who was, perhaps,
the first <i>German</i> composer of secular music in Philadelphia. This
first piece was composed for the following concert:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By Permission and particular Desire,</p>

<p>For the Benefit of Mr. John McLean (Instructor of the German
Flute). Will be performed, at the Assembly Room, in Lodge Alley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
A Concert of Music, Vocal and Instrumental: To begin precisely at
Six o’clock in the Evening. On Thursday the Fifth of December.</p>

<p>The Concert will consist of two Acts, commencing and ending
with favourite Overtures, performed by a <i>full Band</i> of Music, with
Trumpets, Kettle Drums, and every Instrument that can be introduced
with Propriety. The Performance will be interspersed
with the most pleasing and select Pieces composed by approved
Authors; and a Solo will be played on the German Flute, by John
M’Lean, and the whole will conclude with an <i>Overture, composed</i>
(for the Occasion) by <i>Philip Roth</i>, Master of the Band, belonging to
his Majesty’s Royal Regiment of North British Fusileers, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From this advertisement it will be seen that there must have
been an orchestra or band of some importance at this time, and it
is quite probable that the British regiments which at various times
were stationed in Philadelphia, were important factors in extending
the love of music, by means of concerts which the regimental bands
must have given.</p>

<p>In 1772 a concert program of little interest was given at the
State-house,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and in 1774 one by Sigr. Sodi.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> In a previous
chapter was mentioned H. B. Victor, and the concert he intended
to give.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The War of the Revolution soon dawned, and with it matters
of a serious nature engaged the minds of the people, although
occasionally a ball was given, and perhaps regimental concerts.
The play houses, which for over ten years, had been an important
feature, and had been well patronized by Philadelphians, were closed
in 1778 by Act of Congress, but, nevertheless, there was given
occasionally a farce or concert.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Still music and drama were
almost at a standstill during the war.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War it has been stated, that concert
music was at a premium. However in the fall of 1783 was founded
by John Bentley, the City Concert, “which was an important step in
the musical life of Philadelphia.” These concerts were to be given
every two weeks. As no programs have been preserved, we are
unable to determine just what music was used. As Sonneck says:
“It goes without saying that John Bentley engaged the best musicians
to be had in the city and that he performed music in keeping with
the refined taste of such men as Francis Hopkinson and Thomas
Jefferson.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> These concerts were evidently kept up until the
season of 1785-6.</p>

<p>In 1786 a musician arrived in Philadelphia, who was of great
importance to the musical life of that time. This was Alexander
Reinagle one of the ablest musicians in America in that century.</p>

<p>He was born in 1765 at Portsmouth, England, of Austrian
parents.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> He seems to have inherited, as did his brothers Joseph
and Hugh, a love of music from his father, who was a skilful musician.
Alexander studied music in Scotland with Raynor Taylor, who later
became one of the leading musicians in Philadelphia. The material
concerning Reinagle before his arrival in America is scanty, but the
few data there are show that he was known to the musical world of
that time. In a memorandum book<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> of his, preserved in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Library of Congress, is an account of a trip which he took to Lisbon
1784-5 in company with his brother Hugh, an eminent ’cellist,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
who was sick with consumption. They arrived in Lisbon the twenty-third
of October, and Reinagle tells of their lodgings there, expenses,
etc. Of special interest is an item for January, 1785:</p>

<p>“Had a Concert in the Assembly Room 8th Jany.—Performed
to the Queen and R. family Sunday 16th July. Rec’d.
a present from her Majesty of 50 Moids.”</p>

<p>After burying his brother Hugh, who died the nineteenth of
March, 1785, he “embarked from Lisbon Sat. 23d April sail’d 24th
&amp; arrived in Portsmouth Tuesday 17th May. Made in Lisbon:</p>

<p>From these statements it would appear that his trip financially
was a decided success. It would seem from the large sums of money
obtained from his performances at Lisbon, that he must have been
well known as a prominent musician. There is further evidence of
his standing in the musical world disclosed by O. G. Sonneck in an
article in the “<i>Quarterly Magazine of the International Music Society</i>,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
entitled “Zwei Briefe C. Ph. Em. Bachs an Alex. Reinagle.” They
were evidently good friends, as Bach writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monsieur</p>

<p>Je Vous suis infinement obligé du Souvenir dont Vous m’honorez
et je souhaite que Vous veuillez me le conserver toujours;
et dans le cours de vos années les plus riantes. La nouvelle que
Vous me donnez de la triste situation de Mr. Vôtre Frère m’a chagriné
beaucoup; tant par rapport à Vous qu’à lui même. Le Ciel Vous
comble de prospérités, une de plus chères c’est la santé même.</p>

<p>Je Vous envoye la musique, que Vous m’avez demandé, le prix
est fixé au prix ordinaire, la musique que je Vous ai donné pour vous
même, à Hamburg étoit fixée au prix de premuneration, en Vôtre
faveur. Quand Vous m’écrivez une autre fois, ne manquez pas
de me marquer Vôtre sort, auquel je m’interesse beaucoup. En
même temps je Vous prie de me faire avoir vôtre portrait et celui
de Mr. vôtre frère, seulement en dessin, pour les placer dans mon
cabinet de portraits des musiciens. Cela me servira d’aide dans le
souvenir de vôtre amitié, dans le retour de laquelle je suis et serai
toujours.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The other letter is without date, but Sonneck conjectures that
it was written the last of 1785 or the beginning of 1786. It runs as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Liebwehrtester Freund,</p>

<p>Ich bedaure von Herzen den Verlust Ihres lieben und braven
Herrn Bruders eben so sehr, als ich mich über Ihre gute
Aufnahme in Lissabon und glückliche Wiederkunft in London
gefreut habe. Ihr Project wegen meiner gedruckten Rondos kann
mir in der Folge viel Schaden thun, weil meine mit grossen Kosten
von mir in starken Auflagen verlegten Samlungen, worin sie stehen,
unverkauft liegen bleiben werden. Die Liebhaherey zu den Rondos
ist hier eben so gross, wie in London, und ich habe sie deswegen
mit eingemischt, um meinen Verkauf zu befördern. Ich weiss aus
der Erfahrung, dass sehr viele meine Samlungen blos wegen der
Rondos kaufen. Folglich sind mir Exemplare von Ihren verlegten
Rondos nichts nutze, sondern ich wünschte lieber, dass sie gar nicht
nach Deutschland kämen, ohngeacht Westphal hier und Hummel in
Berlin ganze Quantitäten von Ihnen würden kommen lassen. Ich
will jedoch Ihnen, da Sie etwas damit zu verdienen glauben, einen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Weg vorschlagen, wodurch Sie zu Ihrem Endzwecke kommen
könnten, ohne einen Nachdruck befürchten zu dürfen. In der
zweiten, dritten, vierten und fünften Samlung stehen überhaupt
Rondos. Von diesen Samlungen haben Sie 4, aber die 5, glaube ich
haben Sie noch nicht, und kann sie Ihnen, weil 2 Rondos darin stehen,
überschicken. Zu diesen 11 Rondos will Ihnen noch 4 neue Rondos
componieren; Ich will zufrieden seyn, dass Sie mir Erlaubnis zu
dem Drucke dieser schon gedruckten 11 Rondos öffentlich kundthun;
und endlich müssen Sie auch bekannt machen, dass ich ausdrücklich
für Sie noch neue Rondos dazu gemacht habe. Diese 15 Rondos
können Sie in 4 oder wenigern Abtheilungen herausgeben. Es
muss aber in jedem Theile etwas neues davon stehen. Dieses
Mittel und meine öffentliche Erlaubnis sichert Sie gewiss vor einem
Nachdruck.</p>

<p>Für meine Schadloshaltung und für meine neu dazu gekommenen
Composition verlange ich nicht mehr und nicht weniger als 34 Guinees.
Ich verspreche Ihnen zugleich, dass ich die 4 neuen Rondos niemanden
geben noch viel weniger drucken lassen will. Ich kann Ihnen
versichern dass 1 Theil von meinen Samlungen, worin nur 2 Rondos
vorkommen, nach Abzug aller Kosten, mir wenigstens 1000 Mark
hiesiges Geld bisher eingebracht haben, ohne einige 100 Exemplare
zu rechnen, die ich noch vorräthig habe, und welche nach und nach
auch verkauft werden. Die Auslieferung meiner 4 neuen Rondos
auf einmahl geschiehet zugleich bey der Bezahlung auf einmahl.
Wir sind sterbliche Menschen. Wegen der Fantasien künftig oder
mündlich ein mehreres. Eine baldige genugthuende Antwort mit
Ja! oder Nein! elbitte ich mir.</p>

<p>Mit vielen Grüssen verharre ich Ihr Freund und Diener.</p>

<p class="author">
Bach.<br>
</p>

<p>Hier in Deuschland hat mir noch niemand etwas nachgedruckt;
ich würde auch so gleich in den Zeitungen einen solchen Nachdrucker
öffentlich als einen Betrüger erklärt haben, Dafür hält man hier
durchgehends einen solchen Menschen, und das will Keiner wagen.
Meine öffentliche Erlaubnis zu Ihrem Drucke und die neuen eingemischten
Rondos würden ganz gewiss einen Nachdruck zu Ihrem
Schaden abhalten.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These letters merely show that Reinagle before coming to
this country was a capable musician, was known as such by prominent
musicians in Europe, and probably through his intimacy with Bach
would have studied quite extensively the compositions of German
musicians.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p>It was in the year 1786 that Reinagle arrived in New York
with the intention of settling. He inserted the following advertisement
in the <i>New York Independent Journal</i>:</p>

<p>“Mr. Reinagle, member of the Society of Musicians in London,
gives lessons on the pianoforte, harpsichord and violin.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Evidently he did not prosper according to his expectations
in New York, since the same year he established himself in Philadelphia.
He at once became identified with the musical life of this
city, and in conjunction with H. Capron, W. Brown and A. Juhan,
Reinagle continued the “City Concerts” instituted in 1783.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The
first programme played in that year will give some idea of the taste
of the people of that epoch.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this programme that German music had
its share of importance, and in later concerts the compositions
of Mozart, Haydn, Händel, Bach, Pleyel, Abel, Stamitz, Schmittbauer,
Heimberger, etc., were given. Undoubtedly the high grade of these
concerts and the predominance of the works of German composers,
was due to the musical taste of Reinagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>It is not our intention here to give all the programs which were
performed in Philadelphia during this period. Our intention is,
however, to give new material which has hitherto not been published.
The “City Concerts” Sonneck has traced through the year 1788,
and then he adds that “apparently the City Concert was then discontinued
as no further reference to it is made until the attempted
revival in 1792.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Although no records have as yet been found, still it seems very
probable that these concerts were continued without interruption
through 1789-90. For the year 1791 there is a complete file of the
programs given. The opening announcement is as follows:</p>

<p>“The first Concert will be held on Saturday the 22d instant,
at the New-Rooms in Chestnut street, where they will be continued
every other Saturday during the Season.”</p>

<p>Besides the City Concerts, so-called Amateur Concerts were given
at an early period and were still kept up in 1791, contrary to the
belief of O. G. Sonneck. For instance there are advertisements and
programs showing that the usual standard of concert music was
performed.</p>


<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Amateurs’ Concert.</span></p>

<p>A concert will be performed at Mr. Henry Epple’s, at Seven
o’clock this Evening.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Again we are notified that “this Evening the 3d instant there
will be a Ball, only.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> It seems probable that these concerts were
followed by a dance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Foot-Note; At a concert given at Vauxhall in 1792 the instrumental parts
were taken by a number of Germans: Messrs. Phile, Schulz, Tremner, [<i>Scotchman
Bremner</i>,] Roth, Christhilf, Spangenberg etc., (Cf. <i>Am. Daily Adv.</i> June 8, 1792).</p>

<p>Cf. Durang, <i>History of the Stage in Phila.</i>, Chapter 12, who gives the name
Trimmer.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at these programs or at the City Concert programs
published by Sonneck<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> should convince anyone that the musical
taste of Philadelphia was good, also that the German composers
were favorites—at least with the managers—and a predilection was
shown for Abel, Stamitz, Pleyel, and Haydn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Reinagle was not only interested in the artistic production of
music, but also, according to one writer, in the industrial development.
He is said to have had a share in the piano manufactory
established by Charles Tawes.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the residence of Reinagle in Philadelphia, his contemporaries
have something to say. At that time Wignell was an
important factor in the theatrical world and in the fall of 1791 he
“associated himself with Mr. Reinagle, a professor of music in
Philadelphia, and a composer of some note at that time.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> They
founded the first Chestnut Street Theatre, “the corner stone of which
was laid by Mr. Reinagle, a Master Mason, in Masonic form.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The new theatre was opened to the public for the first time on
Saturday evening, April 2d, 1793, “with a grand concert of vocal
and instrumental music.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>“The orchestra department was under the direction of Manager
Reinagle, and the musicians were deemed equal in ability with
the stage artists. In truth the orchestra contained about twenty
accomplished musicians, many of them of great notoriety as concerto
players on their respective instruments.</p>

<p>“The concentration of that early date of so much dramatic,
operatic and instrumental talent, introduced a new era of theatricals
here.</p>

<p>“Who that once saw old manager Reinagle in his official
capacity, could ever forget his dignified personne. He presided
at his piano forte, looking the very personification of the patriarch
of music—investing the science of harmonious sounds, as well as
the dramatic school, with a moral influence, reflecting and adorning
its salutary uses with high respectability and polished manners.
His appearance was of the reverent and impressive kind, which at
once inspired the universal respect of the audience. Such was
Reinagle’s imposing appearance, that it awed the disorderly of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
galleries, or the fop of annoying propensities, and impertinent criticism
of the box lobby into decorum.</p>

<p>“It was inspiring to behold the polished Reinagle saluting
from his seat (before the grand square piano forte in the
orchestra) the highest respectability of the city, as it entered
the boxes to take seats. It was a scene before the curtain that
suggested a picture of the master of private ceremonies receiving
his invited guests at the fashionable drawing room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Reinagle was a gentleman and a musician. His compositions
evinced decided cleverness and originality, and some
of his accompaniments to the old opera music were much admired
by good judges.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>An article by William McKoy presents a clearer picture of
Mr. Reinagle. He says:</p>

<p>“Mr. Reinagle, one of the Managers, and a Professor of
Music, used to be seen, but only on particular occasions, seated
at the Piano Forte, then standing against the stage, in the rear
of the band [orchestra] for the mere purpose of touching a few
notes solo, by way of accompaniment to the silvery tones of Mrs.
Wignell. * * * Mr. Reinagle, while thus enjoying the effect
of her inimitable chant, exhibited to the audience a head not unlike
that of Louis the XIV but divested of the simplicity, bushy,
powdered hair, large high forehead, and round full face, illuminated
by silver mounted spectacle glasses, a perceptible smirk at all times
about the mouth, and an extraordinary depth of dimple in his
cheek, while sitting there and surveying the irritability of Mr. Gillingham,
the Leader of the Band, on his being obliged to leave the music
of Händel and Mozart, and strike off into the ‘President’s March.’”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>In Durang’s account, the compositions of Reinagle are
spoken of highly; there is the testimony of another man, an actor
in Reinagle’s company, to substantiate the above eulogy, as follows
(1804):</p>

<p>“By the death of Wignell * * * the management devolved
upon his widow and Reinagle. * * * The musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
department fell of course to the charge of Reinagle, whose compositions
and adaptations were deserved favorites with the public.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Again, there is the testimony of a man of our own times
to show that the above praise was not undeserved. Speaking of
some of Reinagle’s sonatas, O. G. Sonneck says:</p>

<p>“These sonatas follow closely in the footsteps of Ph. Em.
Bach and the early Haydn without being void of individuality.
If the larger works of Reinagle all were as fine and effective as
these sonatas he must have been a composer of merit.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Sonneck has published titles of forty-two works ascribed to
Reinagle,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> to which we have added several others some of which
are still in existence. These compositions include sonatas, overtures,
preludes, songs, opera music, adaptations, accompaniments,
etc.</p>

<p>From all this evidence it will appear that Alexander Reinagle
must have been a great force in music in Philadelphia, and did much
to shape the taste of the people for good music—especially for
German music, and may thus be called the greatest German American
musician of that century.</p>

<p>Concerning his home life, it is known that Reinagle was
married and had two sons, Hugh, a scenic painter of some note,
and Thomas. The later years of his life Reinagle spent in the
management of a theatre in Baltimore, where he died September
21, 1809.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Philip Roth and Philip Phile</span></p>


<p>Although Alexander Reinagle was the greatest musician of this
period there were others of importance as Juhan, Moller, Capron,
Brown, Schetky, Wolff, etc., etc. It is not our intention to take up
these men separately, as material is too scanty to warrant it.
Sonneck has given short biographies of most of these men.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> There
are two men, however, Philip Phile and Philip Roth about whom
we know considerable. They were both musicians of no mean
calibre, appeared frequently in the concerts given in Philadelphia, and
were also composers of music.</p>

<p>Philip Roth’s first public appearance, as far as is known, was in
1771 at the benefit concert of John M’Lean, when an overture composed
by him “for the occasion” was performed.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This piece was,
perhaps, the first of importance composed by a German in Philadelphia.
The advertisement speaks of him as “Master of the Band,
belonging to his Majesty’s Royal Regiment of North British Fusileers.”
However, as will be shown later, he was undoubtedly a true German.</p>

<p>From 1771 to 1785 we lose sight of Roth, but then he appears as
a music teacher in Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It is quite likely that he was
here still earlier. He lived in Philadelphia from 1785 on until his
death in 1804.</p>

<p>The importance of Philip Roth lies in the fact that it has been
claimed by some, that he is the composer of “The President’s March”
to which the song “Hail Columbia” was set. Others claim that
Philip Phile was the author. The claims of Philip Roth, which at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the most are meagre, rest upon an article in a newspaper of 1829,
written by Wm. McKoy, twenty-five years after Roth was dead.
This article, as will be shown, contains one error, and may contain
others. The article in question reads thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The seat of the Federal Government of the thirteen United
States being removed to Philadelphia, and in honor of the new
President Washington, then residing at No. 190 High Street, the
March, ever since known as the President’s March, was composed by
a German Teacher of Music, in this city, named Roth, or Roat,
designated familiarly by those who knew him, as ‘Old Roat.’ He
taught those of his pupils who preferred the flute, to give to that
instrument the additional sound of the drone, while playing in imitation
of the Scotch Bagpipe. His residence was at one time in that
row of houses back from Fifth, above Race street, at that time known
as ‘The Fourteen Chimnies’ some of which [1829] are still visible in
the rear ground, north eastward of Mayer’s Church. In his person
he was of the middle size and height. His face was truly German
in expression; dark gray eyes, and bushy eye-brows, round pointed
nose, prominent lips, and parted chin. He took snuff immoderately,
having his ruffles and vest usually sprinkled with grains of rappee.
He was considered an eccentric and a kind of drole. He was well
known <i>traditionally</i> at the Sampson and Lion, in Crown Street, where
it seems, his company, in the Olden Time was always a welcome
addition to the Pewter Pint Customers, gathered there, at their
Pipes and Beer, while listening to his facetious tales and anecdotes,
without number, of High Life about Town, and of the Players:
Nick Hammond, Miss Tuke, Hodgkinson, Mrs. Pownall, and Jack
Martin of the Old Theatre in Southwark. This said President’s
March, by Roat, the popular songs of Markoe,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> the City Poet, in
particular the one called ‘The Taylor done over,’ and the beautiful
air of ‘Dans Votre Lit,’ ... were sung and whistled by
everyone who felt freedom (of mind) to whistle and sing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Public opinion having ... released itself from a passion
for French Revolutionary Musick and Song, experienced a vacuum
in that particular, which was immediately supplied by the new,
National American Song of ‘Hail Columbia happy Land,’ written in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
’98, by Joseph Hopkinson, Esq.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> of this city, and the measure
adapted by him very judiciously, to the almost forgotten President’s
March. Even since 1798, the song of Hail Columbia, by Joseph
Hopkinson, and the President’s March, by <i>Johannes</i> Roat, being
indiscriminately called for, have become, in a manner synonymous
to the public ear and understanding, when they are actually and
totally distinct in their origin, as above mentioned.</p>

<p>“Such was the popularity of the song, that very frequently has
Mr. Gillingham, Leader of the Band, [Orchestra], been forced to
come to a full stop in the <i>foreign</i> music, he had arranged for the evening
by the deafening calls for this march, or song to the march.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the first place, we wish to pick out a few errors, which will
show why we must use this testimony with caution. The writer
says that Roth was “well known traditionally,” evidentially not
personally known to him. Again he says that the “President’s
March” at the time “Hail Columbia” was written was “almost
forgotten,” but on the contrary the actor, Gilbert Fox, urged Joseph
Hopkinson to set words to that tune on account of its popularity.
Thirdly, he says that the march was written by <i>Johannes</i> Roat.
This is evidently an error in the Christian name due to traditions as
we will try to show. We have gone carefully through the city
directories from 1785 (when they were first printed,) to 1806; also
the newspapers of that time, and wills and letters of administration
but find no record of a “Johannes” Roat. We find a <i>Philip</i> Roth,
and we shall strive now to give proof that they were one and the
same, as so far there has been no adequate statement of this fact.</p>

<p>To recapitulate: Philip Roth, we have already discovered, was a
Band Master in a British regiment in Philadelphia, and wrote an
overture in 1771.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> All trace of him is lost during the war, but
he probably continued to fill his position in the British Army, or
possibly the same position in the U. S. army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>In 1785 there is the name Philip Roots in the city directory.
In 1788 he has an advertisement in the newspaper,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> while in 1789
we have the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Roth, Music Master, In Pennington Alley running from
Race to Vine Streets, between Fourth and Fifth Streets.</p>

<p>“Teaches all kinds of Instrumental Music in the shortest manner,
viz. Harpsichord or Piano Forte, Guitar, Flute, Hautboy, Clarinet,
Bassoon, French Horn, Harp and Thorough-Bass, which is the
Ground of Music, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In this advertisement we have Mr. Roth; not Philip nor
Johannes. This would imply that the above-mentioned man was
the only person in Philadelphia by the name of Roth who was
a music teacher. There was no city directory after 1785 until 1791.
In this year there appears this entry:</p>

<p>“Philip Roth, musician 25 Crown St.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Now turning to the advertisement again we read that Mr. Roth
lived:</p>

<p>“In Pennington Alley running from Race to Vine Streets, between
Fourth and Fifth streets.” But the city directory informs
us that Crown St., and Pennington Alley were one and the same.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
To go a step further, let us compare the article on the ‘President’s
March,’ above quoted, as to the abode of Johannes Roat, which says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His residence was at <i>one</i> time in that row of houses back from
Fifth, above Race street, at that time known as ‘The Fourteen
Chimneys’ ... north-eastward from Mayer’s Church.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now comparing these three dwelling places, we find that they
were on the same street—at least two of them—and the third in the
same neighborhood; but we find that there was only one man, which
our evidence gives, so we may be perfectly sure that the other two
men may be fused into the one—Philip Roth. This man lived,
while he was in Philadelphia in one locality as the directories show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>
1791 Philip Roth, musician, 25 Crown St.<br>
1795 Philip Roth, 31 Race St.<br>
1798 Philip Roth, Crown St.<br>
1797 Philip Roth musician, Crown St.<br>
1798 Philip Roth, musician Crown St.<br>
1799 Philip Roth, teacher of music, 33 Crown St.<br>
1800 Philip Roth, teacher of music, 33 Crown St.<br>
1801 Philip Roth, music master, 33 Crown St.<br>
1802 Philip Roth, music master, 33 Crown St.<br>
1803 Philip <i>Rote</i>, music master, 33 Crown St.<br>
1804 Philip <i>Rote</i>, music master, 33 Crown St.<br>
</p>

<p>His name is also given in the directory of 1805, but nevertheless
he died in 1804.</p>

<p>From the above, it is seen that he lived on the same street all
the time he was in Philadelphia, with the exception of the year 1795
when he dwelt at 31 Race St., which however, was not far away.
We see, too, the different appellations given to him, as “musician,”
“teacher of music,” and finally “master of music,” Evidently he
was skilled as a musician, and was respected as such.</p>

<p>Little else is known about Philip Roth, but we may presume
that he played in the orchestra of the “Old Southwark Theatre”—perhaps
was even the leader, since we know that he was well
acquainted with the actors.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> We do know that he composed a
piece of music, or rather set to music a “Hunting Song,” which was
printed in the “Universal Asylum,” April, 1790. He must indeed,
have been a skilful musician to be able to give lessons on all the
instruments in his advertisement—nine in all—although he could
not have been proficient on all. Still he must have been talented.</p>

<p>The date of his death has been misstated by the only author,
who has mentioned it at all. O. G. Sonneck, in his book “<i>Early
Secular American Music</i>” (1905) page 190, and in an article “<i>Critical
Notes on the Origin of Hail Columbia</i>” printed in the “<i>Sammelbände
der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft</i>” (1901) states that Philip
Roth died in 1805.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>
<p>It is true that in the City Directory for 1805 his name is found
while in the directory for 1806 the following entry appears:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rote, widow of Philip, music master, 94 N. 7th St.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To offset the above evidence there is the documentary proof as
follows:</p>

<p>“On the 24th day of September, 1804, Letters of Administration
were granted unto Mary Roth on the Estate of her Husband, Philip
Roth deceased.</p>

<p>$200. Henry Lies of Philadelphia, Victualler. Jacob Grace of
Nor. Liberties, Carter. Sureties.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>


<p>Philip Roth could not have amassed much wealth during
his musical career, since his surety was only $200.</p>

<p>So much for Philip Roth and his claims as author of the “President's
March.” The other claimant is Philip Phile, about whom we
know as little as about Philip Roth. As early as 1784 Phile was in
Philadelphia; as there is a concert advertised for his benefit in that
year.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Somewhat later than this Durang, a contemporary of
Phile tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The orchestra at the beginning of the “Old American Company”
production was Mr. Philo, <i>leader</i>; Mr. Bentley, harpsichord; Mr.
Woolf, principal clarinet, Trimmer, Hecker, and son, violoncello,
violins, etc. Some six or seven other names, now not remembered,
constituted the musical force. The <i>latter</i> were <i>all</i> Germans.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Phile was occupying a somewhat important position—the
leadership of a <i>German</i> orchestra numbering some twelve or thirteen
men. From now on until his death in 1793,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Phile wandered back
and forth between New York and Philadelphia. In 1784 he appears
on the concert programs in the latter city. In 1786 with Alexander
Reinagle he played a duet for violin and ’cello in New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
while the next year he is back again in Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In 1792 he
takes part in a concert together with Philip Roth and other Germans.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
Perhaps Roth was a member of his orchestra. After
1789 he apparently settled down in Philadelphia, and lived on
Race St., between Front and Second.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Such is the knowledge we have concerning Phile’s life. Let us
consider what are his claims to the authorship of the “President’s
March.” As in the case of Roth, the march was claimed for Phile
by his friends; but in his case there are two different accounts of its
origin as follows: 1. First it was claimed for him by his son, who
says he was present when it was played. He says that the march
was composed by his father, and played at Trenton Bridge in 1789
in honor of Washington, who was on his way to New York to be
inaugurated.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> 2. Second, it is said by the nephew of Washington,
G. W. Custis (1860), that this march was played in the John St.
Theatre, N. Y., Nov. 24, 1789 in honor of Washington, who was
present that evening. The composer is said to be a German named
Feyles.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> “Feyles” is a corruption of Phile and we also find it
spelled Philo, Phylo, Phyla, Phyle, Phyles, Fyles, etc.</p>

<p>There are, then, two different statements as to the composition
of this piece by Phile, which would lead us to think, that, in the
minds of the people it was a doubtful question as to how and when
this march was composed. To add to this, the claim that Philip
Roth composed this march, only makes the situation more confused.
Sonneck has pointed out in his article “<i>Critical Notes on the Origin
of Hail Columbia</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> that there was no account in the daily papers
of that time concerning this march, as there probably would have
been, had it been composed in honor of so important a man as
Washington. He, however, inclines to the belief that Phile did write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the march; but until a manuscript with the name of the composer
thereon is discovered, we cannot say with surety who did write it.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
We have, then, these two composers before us and can pay our
money and take our choice.</p>

<p>Concerning the compositions of these two men we know little.
The overture composed by Roth in 1771 has already been
mentioned. Sonneck also gives a “Hunting Song” set to music by
Mr. Roth in 1790. Sonneck credits Phile with the following compositions.</p>

<p>
1787<br>
<br>
1. Violin Concerto by Mr. Phile.<br>
<br>
1790<br>
<br>
2. Harmony Music, Phile.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a><br>
<br>
In addition to these we have:<br>
<br>
1791<br>
<br>
3. Overture by P. to be played at Vauxhall Concert, May 27.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a><br>
<br>
4. Concerto Violin by Mr. Phile. At Vauxhall Sept. 2.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a><br>

</div>


<p>We have tried to show the gradual growth of musical taste in
Philadelphia, especially the taste for German music. As before mentioned
this taste was undoubtedly stimulated mostly by the English
musicians, at least until the last period. In that period the English,
and German musicians, seem to have worked in conjunction to keep
up the standard set by their predecessors. It must not be thought
that German music alone ruled in Philadelphia. During the French
Revolution, especially, many refugees arrived in Philadelphia and
concerts of French music were given and great enthusiasm was
aroused among the American citizens. However, on looking over
the whole century, German music seems to predominate over the
music of other nations in Philadelphia. Musical taste in Philadelphia
after the Revolution will compare favorably with the taste
shown in Europe at the same period.</p>
